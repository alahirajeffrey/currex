Currex is a decentralized wallet application for the Africa Bitcoin Conference: TBD Hackathon that facilitates quick and seamless transactions using the tbDEX protocol, an open-source liquidity and trust protocol that facilitates secure transactions between wallet applications and liquidity providers

## Requirements

- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
